<p><em><strong>Create your own Critical Role campaigns with this sourcebook for the world&#8217;s greatest roleplaying game!</strong></em></p>



<p><em>Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount</em> provides everything you need to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons on the continent of Wildemount (set within the world of Exandria)—a land of war, betrayal, and swashbuckling adventure.</p>



<p>Comprised of four regions, Wildemount provides endless potential for adventure in a land of brewing conflict and incredible magic. Rising tensions boil over into all-out war between the politically dubious Dwendalian Empire and the light-worshiping wastefolk of Xhorhas, supplying a vibrant backdrop for any DnD campaign to explore.</p>



<ul><li>Uncover a trove of new options usable in any DnD game, featuring subclasses, spells, magic items, monsters, and more, rooted in the adventures of Critical Role—such as Vestiges of Divergence and the possibility manipulating magic of dunamancy.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Start a campaign in any of Wildemount’s regions using a variety of introductory adventures, dozens of regional plot seeds, and the heroic chronicle system—a way to create character backstories rooted in Wildemount.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Explore every corner of Wildemount and discover mysteries revealed for the first time by Critical Role Dungeon Master, Matthew Mercer.</li></ul>



<h3>Item details</h3>



<p><strong>Price:</strong> $49.95<br></p>



<p>This book’s contents include the following:</p>



<ul><li>An expansive Wildemount gazetteer.</li><li>Descriptions of the major factions of Wildemount.</li><li>Player options that include new subclasses, new spells, and a tool to help players deeply integrate their characters into the setting.</li><li>New magic items, including weapons that become more powerful to match their wielders.</li><li>New creatures native to Wildemount.</li><li>Four introductory adventures—one for each unique region of Wildemount.</li></ul>



<p>Largely written and helmed by Matthew Mercer, the Dungeon Master of Critical Role and creator of&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;Exandria, this 304-page book features work by talented designers, writers, and artists from the DnD and Critical Role communities.</p>



<p><em>Explorer&#8217;s Guide to Wildemount</em>&nbsp;is an expansive, vivid campaign setting anyone can enjoy regardless of their familiarity with Critical Role, and an open invitation to make the mysteries and dangers of Wildemount your own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Wizards of the Coast, the publishers of Dungeons and Dragons, have revealed a new sourcebook coming this fall. Eberron: Rising From the Last War offers players and dungeon masters alike new tools, lore, and character races, as well as a new class for DnD Fifth Edition: the Artificer.</p>



<p>Eberron: RFtLW explores an alternate setting to the &#8220;traditional&#8221; DnD world of The Forgotten Realms &#8211; where the majority of published adventures, as well as the DnD video games (like the upcoming Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3) take place &#8211; in the warn-torn continent of Khorvaire. The world of Eberron was first introduced during DnD v3.5 in the early 2000s, providing a setting that resembled a steampunk aesthetic rather than classic high fantasy, and has only appeared in one officially-published supplement, the digital Wayfinder&#8217;s Guide to Eberron back in 2018.</p>

<p>The new class, the Artificer, is the first official new class since the Player&#8217;s Handbook was released in 2014. Somewhere between a wizard and a mad inventor, the Artificer melds magic with technology, imbuing their inventions with a powerful arcane essence. The book will also include an adventure path for players that will take them through the world of Eberron, which will also be released for the DnD Adventurer&#8217;s League.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For anyone unfamiliar with Unearthed Arcana. Unearthed Arcana is extra material not found in the official DnD handbooks and guide books. The point of this untested material is to make them available to all users of DnD to play test these new features, subclasses, and even races. It&#8217;s all unofficial material so it may be unbalanced and unfair. Keep this in mind when using this material.</p>



<p>Their minds bristling with power, three new subclasses arrive in today’s Unearthed Arcana: the Psychic Warrior for the fighter, the Soulknife for the rogue, and the tradition of Psionics for the wizard.</p>



<p>The pdf for all these new features can be found at the link below</p>
