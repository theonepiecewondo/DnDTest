<p>Matt Mercer is a staple in the DnD community. He is a voice actor and more importantly a famous DM (Dungeon Master) for the show Critical Role. Critical Role is a show about a group of voice actors playing DnD. Anyways the point of this post is to show that Matt Mercer is quite involved with the community as he often makes his own content for the game, also known as homebrew. Recently he&#8217;s made an entirely reworked DnD class with changes that have been supported by the community. The only way to access the class as of right now is to buy the book at this link <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/301641/Blood-Hunter-Class-for-DD-5e-2020">here</a>. The proceeds from the book are going to help the wildfires in Australia. Worry not though, because the class will be available on the site <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">dndbeyond</a>, later this year. I highly recommend checking out any content posted by Matt Mercer because its of the absolute most quality and some of the most interesting content available.</p>
